# AI Weekly Newsletter for Students

A fully automated, production-ready newsletter project that scrapes, summarizes, and sends the latest AI news to subscribers. Built with Python, FastAPI, Gemini, and Mailchimp, and designed for zero-cost deployment on Render and Vercel.

This project is a perfect portfolio piece to demonstrate skills in full-stack development, LLM integration, automation, and deployment.
